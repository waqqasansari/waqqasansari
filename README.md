## 🎯 What I Do

I architect AI-powered systems that solve real-world problems — from **40% efficiency gains** in talent acquisition SaaS to **real-time LLM integrations** that eliminate manual workflows. My work spans the full stack: designing scalable FastAPI backends, building responsive Next.js frontends, and implementing production-grade AI assistants that users actually love.

```python
class WaqqasAnsari:
    def __init__(self):
        self.role = "Associate Software Engineer @ Axiom Global Technologies"
        self.focus = ["AI/ML Systems", "Full-Stack Development", "API Architecture"]
        self.passion = "Making AI practical, scalable, and human-centered"
    
    def current_stack(self):
        return {
            "backend": ["FastAPI", "Django", "PostgreSQL", "Redis"],
            "frontend": ["Next.js", "React", "TypeScript", "React Query"],
            "ai_ml": ["OpenAI APIs", "LangChain", "RAG", "Vector DBs", "MCP"],
            "data": ["Pandas", "Scrapy", "ETL Pipelines", "MongoDB"]
        }
```
